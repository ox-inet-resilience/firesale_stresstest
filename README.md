# Code for: Foundations of System-Wide Stress Testing

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ox-inet-resilience/firesale_stresstest/master)

Note: This is a simplified version that only retains a fire sale contagion
model, but retains much of the generality of the comprehensive system-wide
stress test model.

The model.py file is a hybrid source code - Jupyter notebook.
There are 3 illustrative experiments:
1. Effect of price impact on systemic risk
2. Effect of initial shock on systemic risk
3. Difference between leverage targeting and threshold model (Cont-Schaanning 2017)

Data taken from 2018 EU-wide stress test results,

# Usage

Requires Python 3.
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Comment out the line `plt.ion()` in simulation.py
3. Add `plt.show()` at the end of simulation.py
4. `python3 simulation.py`

To run the model in a Jupyter notebook:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Edit `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` and add this line `c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = 'jupytext.TextFileContentsManager'  # noqa`. This is to make sure that model.py can be read as a jupyter notebook
3. `jupyter notebook`
4. Execute all the cells in simulation.py

If you want to display model.py in the form of a slideshow, you must do `pip install RISE && jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix && jupyter-nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix`.

# Overview

The framework consist of 5 building blocks: institutions, contracts, constraints, markets, and behaviours.
The simple asset-sale model fills in the 5 building blocks as follows:

### 1. Institutions

1. Banks  
   Each bank has a balance sheet consisting of the following components:
   - asset: cash, tradable asset, other asset
   - liability: loan, other liability

### 2. Contracts

Tradable assets T interconnect the banks.
The cash C, other assets O and the generic liability L do not.
- Tradable
  - action: sell asset
- Loan
  - action: pay loan
- Other assets and liabilities

### 3. Constraints

Each bank faces a leverage constraint.

- Leverage constraint
  - λ := E / A
  - Delever if λ < λ^buffer = 4%
  - Delever to λ^target = 5%
  - Default if λ < λ^min = 3%  
    When this happens, all tradable assets of a defaulted bank are liquidated.

### 4. Markets

The price of each tradable asset p_m is determined using a price impact function.
The price is a function of the net cumulative number of asset sales.
Each asset has its own price impact parameter, which determines the market liquidity of the asset.

Asset market:
- Contains an orderbook
- Price impact (Cifuentes 2005)
  - Price impact formula: `new_price = price * exp(-beta * sold / market_cap)`
  - By default, β is chosen such that when 5% of the market cap is sold, the price drops by 5%.

### 5. Behaviours

Bank only acts to avoid default, by de-levering to a leverage target if its
buffer has been breached. It does this by selling tradable asset proportionally
and paying bank liabilities proportionally.
